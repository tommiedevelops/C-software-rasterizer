generalise program to be able to accept multiple inputs in the input parser and draw all the required
lines

refactor bounds float* into a struct Bounds so it is more readable

maybe do the same for struct Vertex and struct Edge

refactor edges so it stores reference to vertex instead of value (could be useful for vertex shaders)

have an exit procedure using signals to free all allocated memory

write unit tests
